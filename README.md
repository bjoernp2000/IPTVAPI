# IPTV API

This repository contains a database project for IPTV (Internet Protocol television) using WinUI 3. 

IPTV is a system through which television services are delivered using the Internet Protocol suite over a packet-switched network such as the Internet, instead of being delivered through traditional terrestrial, satellite signal, and cable television formats. This project aims to provide a comprehensive database solution for managing IPTV channels, programs, and related information.

## Features

- **Channel Management**: Manage a list of IPTV channels, including their names, logos, URLs, and other relevant metadata.
- **Streams Management**: Manage a list of IPTV streams, related to IPTV channels, check the quality of stream links, etc.
- **Search**: Enable users to search for channels and programs based on keywords, categories, or other criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **WinUI 3**: The user interface framework for creating modern Windows desktop applications.
- **C#**: The programming language used for developing the application logic and database operations.
- **SQLite**: The lightweight database engine used for storing and retrieving IPTV data.
- **Entity Framework Core**: The object-relational mapper (ORM) used for interacting with the SQLite database.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The architectural pattern used for separating concerns and implementing data binding between the user interface and the underlying data model.
- **XAML**: The markup language used for designing the user interface in WinUI 3.

However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web.
